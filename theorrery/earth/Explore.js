It is home to millions of species, including humans, and is the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on its surface. The planet has a complex geological history, with tectonic activity that shapes its surface. Earth’s rotation on its axis leads to day and night, while its orbit around the Sun results in the changing seasons. The planet also possesses a natural satellite, the Moon, which influences ocean tides. Understanding Earth is crucial for sustaining life and addressing environmental challenges.";

Despite being so close to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet; Venus has a thick atmosphere that traps heat. Mercury has a very short orbit, completing one revolution around the Sun in just 88 Earth days. It also has a unique rotational pattern, rotating on its axis three times for every two orbits around the Sun. This peculiar relationship leads to a phenomenon called solar days that differ from Earth days.

This makes Venus the hottest planet in the solar system. The surface of Venus is marked by volcanic plains, large volcanoes, and vast highland regions. It rotates very slowly on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, which is longer than its 225-day orbit around the Sun. Venus also exhibits retrograde rotation, meaning it spins in the opposite direction to most planets. The planet's surface is shrouded in dense clouds, preventing direct observation.

It also has a canyon system, Valles Marineris, that is over 2,500 miles long, making it one of the most dramatic landscapes in the solar system. Mars is about half the diameter of Earth and has a thin atmosphere primarily composed of carbon dioxide, making it inhospitable to human life as we know it. Despite these harsh conditions, Mars has been a focal point for exploration, with numerous missions aimed at understanding its geology, climate, and potential for past life.

Each of these moons has unique features, such as volcanic activity on Io and the potential subsurface ocean on Europa.

The planet has a faint ring system and is orbited by 14 known moons, with Triton being the largest. Triton is unique because it has a retrograde orbit, suggesting it may have been captured by Neptune’s gravity rather than forming alongside it.
